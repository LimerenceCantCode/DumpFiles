1. No .java? It's a dump, and as you will undoubtedly come to learn, my workplace is nothing if not a halfhazard mistake.
2. only relevent files here, gonna have to trust me on that, nothing outside of these files cause or relate to the issue at hand. (besides the entirety of vanilla code) ((damn you notch))
3. why is there so much junk lying around (please refer to 1.)
4. your code is shit. I know. Why do you think i'm asking for help.
